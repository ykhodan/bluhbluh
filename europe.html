                I would love to share some insights about studying in Europe with you, but my university is not the most typical Lithuanian university out there. I study at LCC, an institution that offers a North American style of education, which attracted me because of my American high school experiences. This university counts around 700 students from 64 countries, but nearly half of them Ukrainian. As a Ukrainian myself, the prospect of being surrounded by my own nation while still having the chance to explore diverse cultures was another appealing factor. I chose to major in Contemporary Communication since I want to connect my future career with sales or PR.</p>
              <p class="eu-paragraph">
                I met most of the people in my life whom I currently call my closest friends on campus. We share a dorm room together with my three university friends, and it feels like an ongoing sleepover with your besties. With my LCC friends, we celebrate all holidays, go out to have fun on weekends, and often plan common study sessions.</p>
                <p class="eu-paragraph">
                  Lithuania's location also makes traveling around the EU pretty easy, in contrast to my home country, Ukraine. Of course, there are drawbacks of the location as well, including Lithuania's cold Northern European climate and the coastal winds of Klaipeda, the city where the university is located. Do not expect big city life here either.</p>
                <p class="eu-paragraph">
                  One of LCC's best offerings was the opportunity for me to spend an exchange semester in South Korea, which you can also read about in the corresponding section of my website. LCC provides exchange opportunities, some with scholarships, for all majors, and the vast majority of LCC students who went on the exchange absolutely loved their experiences.</p>
                <p class="eu-paragraph-bold">
                  So, if you're up for the challenge of Lithuanian weather, small town life, and the nuances of cultural diversity, this might be just the place for you!</p>
