                <p>The exchange semester at Kyung Hee University was a life-changing experience that started as the most stressful one. I went there completely alone and with no knowledge about Central Asia. It was a whole new world, and absolutely everything felt different from my previous travels.</p>
                <p>Within the first week, however, I started meeting English-speaking Koreans and international students who were also barely familiar with the culture. In no time, I fell in love with this place to the extent that it is painful for me to write this text and not cry. I made awesome friends and enjoyed every single class I had. I also stopped hating the Korean pop culture and fell in love with the Korean food. Waking around incredible Seoul became a regular part of my life.</p>
                <p> I had the opportunity to explore some of South Korea's other most iconic destinations, including the DMZ, Busan, and Jeju Island. At the end, I got an opportunity to visit Japan for a week, which was also an unfortettable experience.</p>
                <p> Ultimately, the challenges of adapting to a strange culture were totally worth the experience. To anyone considering going on a similar adventure, I would give one advice: do your research before you go so that you are not totally overwhelmed, but try to not overdo it either - leave space for your exchange semester destination to surpise you ;)

                      <p> If you are particularly interested in the university where I spent my exchange semester, I can recommend it to you with confidence.</p>
                      <p> Kyung Hee University has two campuses: Seoul Campus and Global Campus, with the latter one offering a wider variety of English-taugh classes and being located 50 minutes away from Seoul by public trasportation.</p>
                      <p> Both of the Kyung Hee campuses offer a range of extracurricular activities, stunning nature with the distincts four seasons, and a choice of cafes, cafeterias, and grocery stores as well as other conveniences such as post offices, banks, stationery stores, etc.</p>
                      <p> Kyung Hee is regarded as one of the best universities in South Korea, and for a good reason - I have never experiences a more cheerful campus atmoshere in any other places.</p>
