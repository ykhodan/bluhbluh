                <div class="usa-text">
                    <p>During my high school exchange year, I was lucky to connect with my American host family on a deeper,
                      especially with my host dad. It all began with a letter I wrote to my potential host family where I mentioned
                      my love for Star Wars. My host dad chose my letter over others based on that Star Wars reference, and his intuition
                      did not let him down - we turned out to have much more in common. By the halfway point of my exchange, I felt as
                      though he and my host mom were my second parents. We were comfortable sharing our feelings, concerns, and asking for favors.
                      Even after my exchange, I still keep in touch with my host dad over social media and visit our home in the USA whenever I can.</p>
                    <p>I can say that my experience with my host family was close to ideal. Unfortunately, in reality, most experiences are not that colorful.
                      Getting along with your host family is crucial because they are the people you'll be seeing every day - eating together, discussing school,
                      and sharing common spaces. Typically, the exchange programs do not allow you to choose the family. To ensure a smooth experience,
                      it's important to gather as much information as possible about your future family's values, interests, and house rules.
                      Be open and honest with them, sharing your own interests and ideas, as well as any concerns you might have. Create an environment
                      where they feel comfortable with you, and they'll likely respond in the same way. Building a strong relationship with your
                      host family can be one of the most rewarding aspects of your exchange year. </p>

    <h3 class="subtitle">Fitting in with the American High Schoolers</h3>
      <div class="friends">
        <div class="usa-text">
          <p>Unlike my experience with the host family, American teenagers were initially harder for me to get along with. They were very different from what I was accustomed to in Ukraine - their attitudes toward classmates, their humor, and their interests all felt distant. It took me a while to understand the cultural differences and start feeling truly welcome in my American high school environment. Around the halfway point of my exchange year, I could finally say that I had formed a close-knit group of friends, people I could rely on and with whom I could truly have fun without any sense of obligation. I still maintain connections with some of my American friends from that group.</p>
          <p>My experience in the American high school was surprisingly very resemblant of what we see in American teenage dramas. We had our academically successful and good-looking athletes, mean popular girls who were often cheerleaders or dancers, and the typical nerds who lived in their own worlds, often becoming targets of local troublemakers. It was fun to witness these cinematic scenes happen in real life. However, the most important lesson I learned in that environment was not to assign myself to a specific group or clique. The key is to remain yourself and be ready to engage openly with a variety of people. Don't hesitate to share your culture and insights about your home country - you'll see that many students are actually interested. Participate in as many extracurricular activities as possible to connect with like-minded people, not just the ones favored by the popular kids.</p>
